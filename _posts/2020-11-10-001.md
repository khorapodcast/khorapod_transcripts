##### [button press, the channel switches]

##### upbeat electronic music plays]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

Hello, to all you beautiful, beautiful people of the Hellas system! The suns are shining, the planets are in alignment, and it's your favourite member of the Olympian family speaking! Yours truly, Apollo!

##### [studio applause]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

Yes, yes, thank you. Now, before we get into the nitty gritty of this week’s episode of Into The Olympians, I am just delighted to announce an all new lineup of vitamins, tonics, and assorted medicines coming out this year, from me and right into your hot little hands! 

##### [audience ‘ooh’s]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

It's new, it’s fresh, and most importantly, it’s going to be available in all Apollo clinics from the low, low price of only ten thousand drachma per dose! 

##### [studio applause]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

A bottle per day may not keep the doctor away, but it will certainly help!

##### [canned laughter]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

##### [canned laughter]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

Oh. Well, I’m not allowed to comment on that, apparently! Well, without further ado: ladies, gents, everyone in-between, let’s get on with the show! 

##### [studio applause] 

##### [Apollo’s voice begins to fade out]

#### APOLLO [radio]:

And to start with, a segment featuring yours truly, Apollo! A popular question floating around the galactic net these days is: my commentary on this week’s race, which- believe me when I say you don’t want to hear about it. But if you’re really curious, then stay tuned for-

##### [Apollo’s voice abruptly cuts out as someone rapidly hits a radio, thunder and heavy rain can be heard]

#### MEDEA:

Don’t know why I even bother. It’s always the same thing, isn’t it. 

##### [sound of radio being hit again, static briefly cuts in and out]

#### MEDEA:

Old models... can’t pick up any channel within a single light-year’s range, still don’t understand why we can’t switch over. Suppose I should be grateful, really. This way, at least I don’t have to hear any... tabloid gossip. No one talking about poor, poor Jason and his witch of a wife who-

##### [pause]

#### MEDEA:

Coming, auntie!

##### [footsteps walking away] 

##### [the radio crackles back to life, glitching in and out]

#### ATALANTA [distorted]:

...Come in? Come in? ...This is user Atalanta, model Argo, requesting landing. ...Repeat, this is user Atalanta, requesting landing...

##### [the radio crackles out]
