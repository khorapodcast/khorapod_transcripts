# __BEHIND THE VEIL I - LAUNDRY__

#### INTRO

#### SATS:

Hello and welcome, dear listeners, to Behind the Veil, a podcast within a podcast that pulls back the curtain on the Khôra production process. 

Every three episodes, Behind the Veil will bring you all the bloopers, improvised bonus scenes, and cast and crew commentary that your hearts desire. I’m your humble emcee and best friend, Sats Di Stefano, and on today's episode you'll be hearing an improvised scene from actors Mq Quinlan and Clary Cheung — also known as Atalanta and Medusa — that takes place as the ARGO and its newest stowaway are en route to reckon with galaxy sweetheart and major idiot, Herakles Hercules. 

Let's get to it!

#### SCENE

#### MEDUSA:

Say- say that whole thing again, but slower. And also less angry. What did you do with the laundry again?

#### ATALANTA:

It’s not about what I did. Okay, so, Medea. I asked her to do the laundry. I thought y’know, she is a princess, she probably knows how to do something as simple as laundry. I give her the basket, she goes, [MIMICKING MEDEA’S ACCENT] “Oh, okay, I’ll do the laundry.” And then...

#### MEDUSA:

Mm-hm.

#### ATALANTA:

Look, just— here. Look at my tank top.

#### MEDUSA:

Ooh. Oh, I... yeah. 

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah.

#### MEDUSA:

I mean, like, you know, I might be wrong, but it was not this color... last week.

#### ATALANTA:

It was definitely not this color! It used to be white! And then— and then she just decides to go and throw her fancy red dress in with it. And suddenly, I’ve got a pink tank top.

#### MEDUSA:

I mean, it suits you. It— sort of?

#### ATALANTA:

Do you think?

#### MEDUSA:

I don’t— I don’t know. It is so early in the morning. Atalanta, did you seriously drag me out of bed for this?

#### ATALANTA:

Look, it’s not my— Am I the only one in this ship with a reasonable sleep schedule? Look— 6 AM is a perfectly reasonable time to wake up.

#### MEDUSA:

6 AM is a time when we should all be asleep. When we should all be in our beds and not talking about laundry. I was up till five. 

#### ATALANTA:

WHAT?!

#### MEDUSA:

I’ve had barely an hour of sleep.

#### ATALANTA:

Oh my god, go to sleep, Medusa!

#### MEDUSA:

Ech- Echo’s... Echo’s systems are a little complicated, but they’re also really, really, really cool, and I really want to know more, and, look, the last time— 

#### ATALANTA:

Medusa—

#### MEDUSA:

—I tried to fiddle with them..

#### ATALANTA:

Medusa.

#### MEDUSA:

Yes.

#### ATALANTA:

Go get some sleep.

#### MEDUSA:

No.

#### ATALANTA:

Medusa. 

#### MEDUSA:

Look, look, you’re not my mom!

#### ATALANTA:

Medusa, go get some sleep!

#### MEDUSA:

No. Look, whenever I have a normal sleep schedule, as you put it, I have to work through hours where we’re— 

#### ATALANTA:

Okay, okay, look. I get that, you know, you’re— you know how to take care of yourself and everything. You’re not a child; you’ve reminded me several times.

#### MEDUSA:

Yes. Multiple times.

#### ATALANTA:

But, seriously, Medusa, get some sleep. You need to take care of yourself. I— You’re not the only one who can handle any of the ship’s problems. We can take some of that work for you, too. 

#### MEDUSA:

[BEAT, SOFTLY] Alright.

#### ATALANTA:

Okay?

#### MEDUSA:

Okay, I will.

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah, go. I’ll sort out this stupid... dress... 

#### MEDUSA:

Have you talked to Medea about it? Like, you know.

#### ATALANTA:

I— Well— 

#### MEDUSA:

Maybe she’d help you with her fancy Pharmaka stuff; she could probably help you bleach it back to white even.

#### ATALANTA:

I guess, I’m just... ugh. She’s just so insufferable, you know? Medusa, yeah, go get some sleep, okay?

#### MEDUSA:

Alright. Aye, aye, captain. You talk to Medea about the laundry, okay?

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah, yeah. I’ll- I’ll consider it. I’ll get ECHO to wake you up when you’ve had a decent amount of sleep. Okay?

#### MEDUSA:

Off to the market we go, then. Night, captain. Good luck with the... pink.

#### ATALANTA:

Good morning, Medusa. See you soon.

#### MEDUSA:

See you soon.
