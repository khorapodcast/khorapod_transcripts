# __Two Thirds of a Liar__

##### [CALMING LYRE MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### TALESPINNER:

Hello? Are you in there? I didn’t think you had anything today, but I can come back— 

[SILENCE]

Oh! I, uh... are you okay?

That’s okay. It’s... it can be a lot. Do you want me to come back another time? [BEAT] No, I can stay. Um, do you want to hear more of the story today? [BEAT] Okay. We were just past the Labyrinth, right? I think you’re really going to like this part. Here, sit down, and...

[SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]

#### TALESPINNER:

Sing, O Muses, of the weary Medusa and their friends, as they tackle a job from a persuasive space pirate— a job that can ease their burdens, if only they can complete it together. Muses great, grant me the ability to sing to you the Hymn of Two-Thirds of a Liar.

[MUSIC GETS LOUDER, THEN ENDS]

##### [ROBOTS WHIRRING]

#### MEDEA:

Come on, let’s get out of here!

#### ATALANTA:

I can’t!

#### MEDUSA:

Atalanta, please...

#### ATALANTA:

Come here, you— 

##### [CLANG, ATALANTA GRUNTS IN PAIN]

#### MEDEA:

You can’t— 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

List of things that can kill me: Athena’s hunters. The security bots standing between us and a clean exit... And her. If I don’t manage to kill her first. Her own stupid heist, and she couldn’t be bothered to come with. I’m cursing every decision that brought me to this moment. Every action I took since we landed on Delos, two days ago.


##### [THE ARGO]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):
Atalanta’s knuckles were white on the controls as she eased the Argo into the local airspace. Medea had tried to convince her to let Echo do all the steering until that stab wound from Knossos was completely healed, but Atalanta wouldn’t hear of it. I could see the worry in Medea’s eyes, because as much as she didn’t want to admit it— still doesn’t want to admit it—  she cares for her.
I thought I understood a little. My list of things that could kill me had grown, somehow, into several different lists. Things that could kill me, things that could kill Echo, things that could kill Medea. Things that could kill Atalanta. 
I wasn’t used to having lists for anyone else. The other people in my life had always been untouchable. 

#### ATALANTA:

Right. We’re in a bit of a pinch, here. We’re strapped for cash, and we’re gonna need to stock up on rations and supplies before we can keep looking for whoever Phineas was talking about. We should be able to pick up some work here, but we need to be on the same page before we land. 

#### MEDEA:
What kind of work are we talking about?

#### ATALANTA:

At this point? Pretty much whatever we can find. 

#### MEDEA:

You really should still be taking it easy, Atalanta. 

#### MEDUSA:

There’s always demand for a programmer, right? 

#### ATALANTA:

Not here, love. Delos is running on duct tape and paper clips, and those are just to keep the lights on. No one here’s got any software they can’t keep up themselves except the big companies. 

#### MEDEA:

Why do we need to stop so quickly anyway? I looked over the rations yesterday; we could make it to Delphi easily—

#### ATALANTA:
Better work here for our skill set, I think.

#### MEDEA:

Not Medusa’s. 

#### ATALANTA:

Just trust me, okay? Besides, we’re already landing. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

She turned back to the controls, navigating into Delos’s tiny spaceport. It seemed to be a formality more than anything— there was no STSA, no gate control. Delos wasn’t a planet, but a large, lumpy asteroid. Its twin stars were so dim they were barely stars at all, and all I could see on the surface were dark, hulking shapes. As we flew in and the great door closed behind us, I couldn’t help but think of the mouth of some enormous beast, swallowing us whole. 

#### MEDUSA:

What are all those shadows?

#### ECHO:

The planet of Delos is covered in securely insulated domes, allowing habitation on an asteroid orbiting two brown dwarfs. These domes are designed for maximum efficiency around the factories which form the bulk of the planet’s trade. A spokesperson from Nomios Pharmaceuticals, the branch of OlympusCorp responsible for the factories and surrounding facilities, lauded their design as, quote, “a winning solution for resources, energy, and personnel,” end quote, but critics have referred to them as, quote, “soul-sucking brutalist monstrosities,” end quote.

#### ATALANTA:

Thanks, Echo. 

#### MEDEA:

So, what, you think we can pick up a few days making Apollo’s miracle drugs, and then go merrily on our way?

#### ATALANTA:

I’m not that stupid. But employee scrip is pretty common in these parts, and it makes for a pretty solid underground economy. I figure we take up running security for a smuggling operation or something, and then we’re in business again. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

It wasn’t like we had a better plan. But I didn’t know what we were getting into, and I didn’t like the idea of working with wanted criminals. Sure, they could have been like me or Medea, victims of circumstance scraping out whatever living they could find under the Olympians. Or they could have been the kind of thugs Athena used to warn me about, howling and hungry and hunting for blood. 

Hell, I didn’t know if the hitman she had after me would bother to look in a place like this, but crossing paths here wasn’t out of the question.

##### [HAIR WIRES HISS]

#### ATALANTA:

You okay there, Dusa?

#### MEDUSA:

Oh. I— sorry. [SOFTLY] It’s okay. No need for that.

#### ECHO:
User Medusa, User Atalanta is requesting your feedback. Her question was, [PLAYS BACK ATALANTA SAYING “You okay there, Dusa?”]

#### MEDUSA:

I’m fine. I just... are you sure you’re up for this?

#### MEDEA:

I’m with them. I really don’t think—

#### ATALANTA:

‘Course I’m sure! C’mon, put on your shoes. I know a place, as long as it’s still there.

#### MEDEA:

And if it isn’t?

#### ATALANTA:

Then we’ll figure it out! Right, let’s get a move on. 


##### [A CROWDED BAR. A ROWDY HUBBUB OF VOICES]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

I had to be careful to remember my breathing, even as I scanned the crowd. In, out, and a double take every time I saw someone who looked even vaguely like Pallas Tech security. I was still glad I wore a thick enough scarf to hide the twitching motion of my hair. 

#### MEDEA:

Stars, I hate these places. 

#### MEDUSA:

Can you see where Atalanta went?

#### MEDEA:

Still carousing with the best of them. Honestly, if she ever gets sick of the hero business, the woman should be a recruiter or something. 

#### MEDUSA:

I don’t think she’s likely to take that advice anytime soon.

#### MEDEA:

[CHUCKLE] You’re probably right about that. Stars, she’s stubborn. 

#### MEDUSA:
[LAUGH] What, do you care about her or something?

#### MEDEA:

I mean, I wouldn’t leave her to die. Anymore. Anyway, good thing you’re “old enough to drink anywhere in the galaxy,” right? We would’ve had to leave you outside. 

#### MEDUSA:

I don’t think that’s very good parenting on your part.

#### MEDEA:

Eh, what would I know? 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

I knew she was speaking for herself, but some fragment of the words still managed to lodge in my chest. What would I know? It’s not like Athena was a model mother. When I was younger, I thought that was just what family was like. But after everything that had happened, after the things I’d seen in the short weeks since I left...

Ariadne’s image kept sticking in my head. There’s nothing quite like looking at a family and realizing that in the twenty-one years you’ve been alive, you’re not sure you’ve ever been loved. I was a prodigy, a rising talent who could do amazing things with machines. That’s all that mattered. That was all that ever mattered.

##### [SOMEONE BEGINS SINGING LOUDLY. OTHERS JOIN IN]

#### MEDEA:

Ugh, like this place needed to get any louder. 

#### MEDUSA:

Do you want to go outside for a few minutes?

#### MEDEA:

We probably shouldn’t leave Atalanta alone. I can deal with it.

#### MEDUSA:

I can barely hear myself think. I’m sure they’ll quiet down if we ask.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

It wasn’t the entire truth. But if I had told Medea I was going over on her account rather than mine, she’d have tried to stop me. My job on this crew was to take care of Medea and Atalanta, and I was gonna do it.

##### [THE SINGING GETS LOUDER]

#### MEDUSA:

Excuse me, could you tone it down a little?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Depends. How much are you offering?

#### MEDUSA:

What? 

#### ANDROMEDA:

How much are you offering to pay me to shut up? For 10,000 drachme a day, you too can buy my silence!

#### MEDUSA:

Pay ten thousand— Some of us are trying to enjoy a quiet night out.

#### ANDROMEDA:

If quiet’s what you’re looking for, I don’t think this place is your bag. Again, though, I’ll consider it if you’ve got any cash. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

The stranger was standing on the table with impressively polished leather boots. Their long hair fell loose down their back as they grinned at me - clearly drunk, but there was still a strange sharpness to that smile.

#### MEDUSA:

I don’t have any— would it really kill you to be a few decibels quieter?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Quite possibly. I can’t say I’ve ever tried it.

#### MEDUSA:

Well, there’s no time like the present. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

How about instead, I buy you a drink, and you come up here and join me?

#### MEDUSA:

I don’t want you to buy me a drink, I want you to show a little basic public courtesy. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

[SPUTTERS] I’m already blessing y’all with my roguish charm. Not sure how much more courteous I could be.

#### MEDUSA:

Roguish? Is the bar really that low these days?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Uh-huh.

#### ATALANTA:

Medusa? You all right? 

#### MEDUSA:

[GRUMBLES] Oh my stars. I’m fine. They— pronouns?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Oh, you couldn’t get it wrong if you tried. Generally she, but anything works. 

#### MEDUSA:

She was just being a bit loud. I came over to politely request she tone it down.

#### ANDROMEDA:

And I was just telling— [CLEARS HER THROAT]

#### MEDUSA:

Her or them. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

--her to relax and join me. I have some great stories to tell, and only two-thirds of them are complete lies. 

#### ATALANTA:

It’s not worth arguing with anyone this drunk. Let’s just go somewhere else. Plenty of places to find a job, right?

#### ANDROMEDA:

A job?

#### ATALANTA:

Enjoy your night, sir. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Hang on, there. If you’re looking for work, I might have an opportunity for you.

#### MEDUSA:

You just said that two-thirds of your stories would be lies. Why should we trust you?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Frankly, you shouldn’t, but you can trust that I like making money and ticking off local overlords. 

#### MEDUSA:

Yeaaaah no, you’re still not inspiring a lot of confidence. 

#### ATALANTA:

What kind of job are we talking about?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Now, hang on, why should I trust you? After all, I only met this one because [DRAMATIC FAKE SADNESS] she decided to bully me. 

#### MEDUSA:

I didn’t decide— you absolute hypocrite!

#### ATALANTA:

Let’s just talk, yeah? Next round’s on me.

#### MEDUSA:

Atalanta!

#### ANDROMEDA:

Well, that is a compelling argument. Lead the way.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

After asking for the stranger’s drink preference, Atalanta made for the bar to order another round, leaving me to lead her to our table. 

#### MEDEA:

Who’s this?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Captain Andromeda of the starship Archer, scourge of the Khôra, robber of kings, and, depending on who you ask, sworn enemy of the Nereids. I think we’re friends, personally.

#### MEDEA:

...what?

#### MEDUSA:

Don’t ask. She’s already said that she’s a liar. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Now, I hardly think that’s fair. At most, you could call me two-thirds of a liar. Assuming I was telling the truth in the first place. 

#### MEDUSA:

[UNDER THEIR BREATH] But if she’s two-thirds of a liar and she said she’s two-thirds of a liar, then that means the probability of her actually being two-thirds of a liar is only four ninths and—

#### MEDEA:

Huh?

#### MEDUSA:

[STILL MUTTERING] And if she really does mean what she says then...

#### ANDROMEDA:

Ooh, I never thought I’d like it here!

#### MEDEA:

WHY.

#### MEDUSA:

Um, anyways! She mentioned a job. Atalanta’s getting drinks now. 

#### MEDEA:

And we’re interviewing with her why?

#### MEDUSA:

I don’t know. Atalanta should be back in a minute. You can ask her then. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

In the meantime, I don’t believe either of you have introduced yourselves. It’s so rude to keep your guest in the dark.

#### MEDUSA (narration):

I didn’t know why Atalanta had chosen her of all people to look for a job with, but I didn’t want to ruin whatever her plan was. However much the bastard grated on me— however much I wanted to knock that stupid grin off her face— I could play nice. 

#### MEDUSA:

Medusa. Pleasure to meet you. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Enchantee. I have to say, though, that name sounds familiar. 

#### MEDUSA:

Don’t worry about it. I’m sure it’s nothing. [NERVOUS LAUGH]

#### ANDROMEDA:

Hmm. And you are?

#### MEDEA:

Medea. She/her.

#### ATALANTA:

Great, we’re all here. Let’s sit down; I’ve got everyone a refill. I’m Atalanta, by the way. I use she and her. Now, what’s this job?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Y’know Nomios?

#### MEDEA:

Yes?

#### ANDROMEDA:

I could use a hand breaking into one of their factories. My usual crew is being very rude at the moment.

#### MEDUSA:

What does that mean?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Oh, you know, sometimes your roommates get it into their heads that you’re “embarrassing them” or “not shutting the hell up” or whatever, and sometimes those roommates decide to kick you off a moving spaceship to “get it out of your system” or something. Like I said, rude. But life has to go on.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

Medea and I looked at each other, but none of this seemed to worry Atalanta as she and Andromeda went back and forth about the details of the job. Breaking into the factory’s storage, loading up bags with medicine, and slipping out without a sound. She did make the job sound easy. But coming from her, that meant nothing. 

#### MEDEA:

Right. And what happens to this stuff once we hand it all off to you?

#### ANDROMEDA:

‘Scuse?

#### MEDEA:

Why are you after these meds? Smuggling? Black market?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Does it really matter?

#### MEDEA:

Yes. I want to know how you’re planning on getting paid, and how you’re planning on paying us.

#### ATALANTA:

She has a point. Kids your age don’t usually have the kind of money to hire crew. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

[STUTTERS] I’m twenty-two, for your information.

#### ATALANTA:

She still has a point. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

I ain’t gonna take the goods and run, if that’s what you’re wondering.

#### MEDUSA:

That’s not an answer.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Fine. If we’re being honest, I have no idea what the meds are for.

#### MEDUSA:

Wait, then why are you even asking us to— 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Couldn’t tell you. But my boss wants them, and I promise she pays handsomely.

#### MEDEA:

Who’s this boss?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Lady called Aristo. She tends to keep a low profile, but it’s— well, I can’t say it’s honest work, but it is work, and it’s certainly better than anything you can find above board. Especially if you’re wanted for treason. Or murder.

#### MEDUSA:

Why would you say that? 

#### MEDEA:

Is that a threat?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Calm down. I’m not planning on turning either of you in, or I wouldn’t be trying to get you in on a heist in the first place. I’m just saying, your options are limited. There are worse things than working with an experienced pirate. 

#### ATALANTA:

But— Pirate?

#### ANDROMEDA:

The best part of the job is picking your own title. So, are you in?

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

Atalanta looked to Medea for confirmation, who reluctantly nodded. Then she looked to me. I was still hesitant, but... we did need a job. I nodded.

#### ATALANTA:

We’re in. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Perfect. We’ll break in tomorrow night. Do any of you have hacking experience?

#### MEDUSA:

I do.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Of course you do.

#### MEDUSA:

Hey!

#### ANDROMEDA:

If you’ve got a place to stay, we can plan there.

#### ATALANTA:

We’ve got a ship, and our AI should be able to help us access whatever we need. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Well, then. We’re in business.


##### [THE ARGO]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

The next evening came before I knew it, and suddenly it was time to go.

#### ANDROMEDA:

All right, folks. Remember the plan.

#### MEDEA:

Right. I’m still wondering why we’re the ones going in for your heist? 

#### ANDROMEDA:

It’s our heist now. Besides, you’ve already worked together. I’ll be here ready to whisk you off to safety when you’re done, and Echo will keep an eye on things. You got your radios?

#### ATALANTA:

Right here. We’ll keep in touch.

#### ECHO:

User Atalanta, you are injured. Your health and safety are always in my best interest.

#### MEDEA:

I’m still with her. You don’t have to come, Atalanta.

#### ATALANTA:

I told you both, I’m fine. You can stop trying to get me to stay back.

#### MEDUSA:

I think we’re all just worried about you. If you need rest, you can help Andromeda whatever she’s— 

#### ATALANTA:

I don’t need rest. I’m your captain. I think I have a right to come.

#### MEDEA:

[MUTTERING] Co-captain.

#### ATALANTA:

Are we ready?

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

Thankfully, the factory wasn’t far from the spaceport. Earlier, the domes had been lit with buzzing fluorescent lights in some hollow mockery of sunlight, but now those lights were gone, replaced with sodium-orange lamps at regular intervals. I couldn’t see anyone else nearby, but I couldn’t shake an uneasy feeling.

##### [WIRE HAIR HISSES]

#### MEDUSA:

It’s all right. This is the plan.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

We weren’t turning our radios on until we reached the factory, since we didn’t want to run out of power. Through the quiet, I could hear our footsteps, the buzz of the systems keeping Delos running, and not much else. Not until we got to the factory.

##### [METAL CREAKING, MECHANICAL HUM]

#### MEDEA:

What’s that sound?

#### MEDUSA:

The machinery is settling. It’s all just running on its normal night rhythm. 

#### ATALANTA:

Are you ready, Medusa?

#### MEDUSA:

As I’ll ever be. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

We walked up to the employee entrance. I knew going in that it operated on a chip reader, compatible with subdermal implants in employees’ wrists, but I still shuddered when I saw it. Most of my modifications were my choice. The ones that weren’t... I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

##### [TOOLS RATTLING]

Most chip readers are simple enough. They operate on a key specific to the facility, but the memory is stored in the lock. Put together something that can read the key and feed it back in, and...

#### MEDUSA:

Right... just plug this in, and... there.

##### [FABRIC RUSTLES. THE COMPUTER BEEPS AND THE DOOR OPENS WITH A THUD]

#### ATALANTA:

That easy?

#### MEDUSA:

I’m guessing they were depending on this place only seeing manufacturers. Come on. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

Inside the factory was dark. I reached into my pocket and flipped on my radio. Atalanta and Medea did the same.

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

You still alive?

#### ATALANTA:

Yep. We’re headed for the locker rooms now. 

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

Perfect. You should find uniforms for the factory there. I’m not exactly sure what kind of scans these security drones run, but hopefully being in uniform will at least buy you some time. Assuming something goes wrong and you run into them at all. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

The uniforms were in the locker rooms, and we slipped the green jumpsuits over our clothes. [FABRIC RUSTLING] I thought back to the plan Andromeda had talked us through. We would pick up as much medicine as we could, leave storage through the other door, and come back the way we entered. Simple. 

##### [FARAWAY METAL THUMPS]

I could hear the echoing clanks of the security droids in equipment storage, and that made me uneasy. If we could hear them, what was stopping them from hearing us? 

The three of us crept through the hallways, passing through the two airlocks like shadows. It was almost too easy, but even so, I started to get my hopes up. Maybe we really would be in and out. 

##### [MEDEA STOPS. MEDUSA BUMPS INTO HER WITH AN “OOF”]

#### MEDEA:

First door. This should be it. 

#### ATALANTA:

Perfect. Medusa?

#### MEDUSA:

Right.

##### [WIRE HAIR HISSES. THE DOOR BEEPS AND OPENS]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

The room was more open than I expected. The walls were covered with industrial shelving, but the floor only had large boxes resting on pallets. Still, the dark made it feel looming. Like craggy teeth in the jaw of a monster. 

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

Ya’ll in?

#### ATALANTA:

Yes. Everyone, grab as much as you can fit in your bags and pockets. 

#### MEDEA:

Aye-aye, co-captain. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

I moved toward the boxes on the floor, while Medea and Atalanta went for the shelves. The crate in front of me was chest-height, and filled to the brim with neatly-stacked boxes, each of them emblazoned with the stylized sun of Nomios Pharmaceuticals. [FABRIC RUSTLING] I grabbed as many as would fit in my hands and shoved them into my bag before moving to the next crate.

It was... thrilling, in a way. At Pallas Tech, I took every step like the floor was made of glass. [BOTTLES CLINKING] I had to be the model child, the prodigy, Athena’s perfect little ward. The closest thing I got to a teenage rebellion was dyeing my hair, before I replaced it, and even that led to an hour long lecture about images and professionalism.

Here, doing something to strike back, something that had the chance to help people in a way I’d never truly been able to before... exhilaration ran through me like a current. I couldn’t believe I was doing this. I couldn’t believe I’d broken away. 

My bag was full in minutes, and I met Medea at a door at the other side of the room. Atalanta’s bag was half-full, and she was still scouring the shelves. 

##### [DISTANT WHIRRING OF ROBOTS]

#### MEDEA:

Atalanta, what are you doing? Just grab whatever fits before we get caught.

#### ATALANTA:

I just... uhh, want to make sure I can get what will be useful. To Andromeda. 

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

It’s all useful. This isn’t spaceship shopping, you don’t need to be picky.

#### ATALANTA:

Why don’t you two go ahead, and I’ll be right behind you?

#### MEDUSA:

What?

#### MEDEA:

Don’t be an idiot. We’re not leaving you behind. Just get a move on. 

#### ATALANTA:

I’m serious. I’ll be fine. It’ll just be an extra minute. 

#### MEDEA:

Why the hell would we do that? It doesn’t make any goddamn sense.

##### [WIRE HAIR HISSES]

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

This isn’t the best time for a lover’s quarrel, ladies.

#### MEDUSA:

Atalanta, I think what Medea’s trying to say is that she’s— that we’re confused. We don't understand your plan, and we’re worried about your safety. So let’s just go!

#### ATALANTA:

Why are you all so worried about my safety? I can handle myself. I’m not going to break the moment one of you looks away!

#### MEDEA:

No, but you’ll definitely break if you do something reckless and it gets you killed. 

##### [METAL SOUND GROWS LOUDER]

#### MEDUSA:

I know we can work this out, but let’s lower our voices please? We don't want to alert the security bots.

#### ATALANTA:

I’m not being reckless, I’m taking a tactical risk. 

#### MEDEA:

And what exactly is your tactic? 

#### ATALANTA:

Just go, I’ll only take a second— 

##### [ROBOTS WHIRRING]

#### ATALANTA:

Damn.

#### MEDUSA:

Look out!

##### [METAL CLATTER]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

Atalanta ducked just in time to miss a swing from a security droid’s segmented metal arm. There were four or five of them, built of brass and trundling on worn rubber treads. Gods, they had to be at least twenty years old. Their designs were... clunky. Inelegant. But not any less dangerous for it. 

#### MEDEA:

Come on, let’s get out of here!

#### ATALANTA:

I can’t!

#### MEDUSA:

Atalanta, please...

#### ATALANTA:

Come here, you— 

##### [CLANG, ATALANTA GRUNTS IN PAIN]

#### MEDEA:

You can’t punch a robot, Atalanta!

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

This was not the plan, y’all. 

#### MEDEA:

Stay here, kid. Hold this.

##### [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]

#### MEDUSA (narration):

Which brings us up to the present. I clutch Medea’s bag to my chest as she dives into the fray, dodging robots left and right to get to Atalanta and grab her arm. But I don’t have time to focus on them, or think of wringing Andromeda’s neck- I still only have a moment to slip away. 
The bot doesn’t follow me, just stands in front of the airlock, and I realize what it’s doing.

#### MEDUSA:

Damn it!

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

This was not the plan!

#### MEDUSA:

Yes, I heard you the first time!

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

One of them is parked at the entrance, leaving three to take us down. Hand-to-hand combat isn’t an option, Medea’s knives are useless, and she’s not in a position to create a solution with Pharmaka. At some point, Atalanta managed to tear open her stab wound, and it’s clearly starting to slow her down. We’re cornered and defenseless. 

Almost. 

##### [MEDUSA DUMPS BOTH BAGS ON THE GROUND. FOOTSTEPS]

#### MEDUSA:

Atalanta, Medea! Take cover!

#### MEDEA:

Here!

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

While the bots turn to me, distracted by my shout, Medea drags Atalanta behind one of the big boxes. It will have to be enough. 

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):

What are you doing?

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

The hairs on my arms stand up, and static crackles through my body. [WIRE HAIR HISSES] My hair writhes, a frightened pit of vipers. They couldn’t protect me from Athena. They couldn’t protect others from her— from our tech. [THE WIRES BEGIN TO CHARGE WITH ELECTRICITY] But in this strange new life, I only have one job, and I will do it. I will protect my friends.

##### [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES. A LOUD BANG, THE ROBOTS BEEP. WIRES FIZZLING. THUDS AS THEY HIT THEY GROUND]
MEDUSA (NARRATION):

I’m on my knees, concrete floor managing to seep a chill into me even through my clothes. My whole body trembles, and my head spins and aches. For a moment, I’m back in my room at Pallas Tech, door locked behind me and half the wires torn out of my skull. I shake my head, and the present comes back into focus. 

#### ANDROMEDA (RADIO):
...Well, that sure came in handy. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

#### ATALANTA:

Medusa?

#### MEDUSA:

I... yeah. Yeah, I’m here. 

#### MEDEA:

Right. Let’s get out of here.

#### ATALANTA:

Wait. 

#### MEDEA:

Those things could have killed us, Medusa could have killed themself, and you still want to wait?

#### ATALANTA:

Just a minute. Please. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS. BOTTLES CLINK]

#### MEDEA:

Is that... why do you need that? Look, Andromeda said not to worry about anything specific, we just—

#### ATALANTA:

It’s not for Andromeda. 

##### [BEAT]

We can go now. I’ll— I’ll explain later. Medusa, are you good to walk?

#### MEDUSA:

Yeah. Yeah, let’s go.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

The bags are right where I left them. I fish the device out of mine and open the airlock. [DOOR OPENS] I’m still shaking, and it takes most of my concentration just to stay on my feet. A glance at Atalanta suggests it’s the same for her. Getting out of the factory is all a blur. It’s still dim outside, and all three of us are silent as we trek back to the Argo.

##### [THE ARGO’S DOOR OPENS]

#### ANDROMEDA:

Are y’all alright? 

#### MEDEA:

Let’s just get these two some medical care.

#### ANDROMEDA:

That... does seem like the best course of action. Come on in.


#### ATALANTA:

The thing had to have been at least fifteen meters long—

#### MEDEA:

It wasn’t that big.

#### ATALANTA:

— so after she cut off a bit of my hair, she ran down to make whatever explosive could kill it, while I headed back to the cockpit to steer us away. The chimera’s claws screeched against the hull—

#### MEDEA:

I’m pretty sure that was the machinery, Atalanta. You were making a sharp turn and your driving is... well.

#### ATALANTA:

But anyway, as soon as she saw it she fired. It let out one last horrible screech—

#### MEDEA:

I’ll agree with you on that one.

#### ATALANTA:

--before it drifted off into the Khôra.

##### [HOOTS FROM MEDUSA AND ANDROMEDA]

#### MEDEA:

It really was not as heroic as she makes it sound. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Even so, taking down a chimera with only two crew members is nothing to sneeze at. [GASP] Reminds me of the time I was in—

#### MEDEA:

Have you finished making that tea yet?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Yeah, yeah, it’s here. Black tea for us two, and, ugh, whatever that is for Medusa and Atalanta.

#### MEDEA:

It’s a basic herbal mixture with restorative properties and a bit of pain relief. Uh, it’s also safe in combination with most pain medications. 

#### ATALANTA:

I... thank you.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

We’re all resting in the common room, since the medbay isn’t exactly cozy. Atalanta reclines on the couch, freshly bandaged and avoiding Medea’s eyes. Andromeda sprawls onto one of the armchairs after passing out teacups, while I rest in a nest of blankets on the floor. The whole thing is so domestic, so comfortable, like a picture book or a postcard. My tea is warm in my hands and has a vaguely sweet scent and after some rest, my exhaustion from earlier has softened into a gentle tiredness. I want to freeze here, let this picturesque moment become my whole existence, lay down the burdens of Nomios and Pallas Tech and running. I know it can’t last. I know I’ll have to pick everything up again. But I’m so tired. 

#### ATALANTA:

I think I owe you an explanation. About what happened. 

#### MEDUSA:

It’s your business. If you don’t want to talk about it, you don’t have to, Atalanta—

#### ATALANTA:

I think I made it your business back there. And... I do want to tell you. I injured my back pretty badly, not long after I left the Argonauts. It didn’t heal all the way, and it still gives me a lot of pain. I take meds for it, but I’ve been running low.

#### MEDEA:

Why didn’t you just say that?

#### ATALANTA:

Hey, in my defense, I wasn’t sure you weren’t going to try to kill me until, like, week three. 

#### MEDEA:

Fine, but at some point after that? You could have said so, we could have helped you find what you needed. We didn’t have to fight our way out of every— 

#### MEDUSA:

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on. Let’s all take a breath. We don’t need to snap at each other or— or attack each other— or—

##### [THEY BEGIN TO CRY]

#### MEDEA:

Medusa?

#### MEDUSA:

I— I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry...

#### ATALANTA:

It’s okay, Dusa. You don’t need to apologize. C’mon, will you breathe with me?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Hey, short stuff. Look, you’ve got your tea, right? Take a sip of that.

##### [MEDUSA QUIETS DOWN]

#### ANDROMEDA:

Great. Now breathe, just like Atalanta said. 

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

[TAKING DEEP BREATHS] Slowly, my hair stills and my heart settles back into a normal rhythm. I’m okay. I’m okay. 

#### MEDUSA:

I’m sorry.

#### MEDEA:

Don’t apologize. It isn’t your fault. 

#### MEDUSA:

Yeah, I... yeah.

#### ATALANTA:

Do you want to tell us about it?

#### MEDUSA:

It’s just a lot. Things are better now than they’ve been in a long time, and I really like it here, and that’s stupid to cry over but I don’t want to lose this, and if I don’t do my job I will, and today was just really bad—

#### ATALANTA:

What do you mean, your job?

#### MEDUSA:

My job. You brought me on to help you and Medea. So I could stop your arguments. I didn’t do that today.

#### MEDEA:

Oh. No, Medusa...

#### ATALANTA:

That’s not why you’re here, Medusa. You’re part of this crew because we care about you. It isn’t your job to sort out our problems.

#### MEDUSA:

It isn’t?

#### ATALANTA:

Of course not. That’s on us. You’re here because we care about you. We like being around you, and we like being your friends. We aren’t gonna kick you out, for any reason. You’re with us now.

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):

I turn that over in my head. One of them. Not an employee, or an asset, or a great young mind. Part of a crew. It’s hard to believe it. But I want to.
Maybe I’m not okay. But I think this is a safe place not to be. 

#### MEDUSA:

Thank you. I like being your friend, too.

#### ATALANTA:

We’re glad to have you, kid. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Well! I think this success deserves a celebration. If y’all are up for it, of course. 

#### MEDUSA:

I could use a celebration.

#### ATALANTA:

Certainly couldn’t hurt anything.

#### MEDEA:

So long as it’s a restful one.

#### ATALANTA:

Don’t worry, love, I’ve had that stitched up twice. I’m not keen to have to do it a third time. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

In that case, let’s toast! With, uh, teacups. To a job... well, “well done” might not be the word for it, but it’s certainly done!

#### MEDEA:

Here’s to that. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

And to good tea!

#### ATALANTA:

Why the tea?

#### ANDROMEDA:

We may as well get ourselves excited about something.

#### MEDEA:

Well, in that case, here’s to finally getting some rest.

#### ATALANTA:

And to the best ship in the galaxy to rest on!

#### ANDROMEDA:

...your ship is at least twenty years old.

#### MEDUSA:

It’s in good condition, though.

#### ANDROMEDA:

I just think you could make some upgrades! I don’t know, think outside the box, like... like if you gave it arms to punch with! 

#### MEDEA:

If we what.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Arms! That would’ve helped with the chimera.

#### MEDUSA:

Ooh.

#### ECHO:

Major untested alterations to an active ship are dangerous and inadvisable—

#### MEDUSA:

How would that work, though? I mean, I guess if you could put metal plates locking over each other for dexterity... Oh, that could!

#### ANDROMEDA:

Give the fists spikes!

#### MEDUSA:

That wouldn’t even be too hard. They’d require extra fuel, but that could easily be provided by—

#### ECHO:
Now showing results for: Mortal Terror. 

#### ATALANTA:

Hang on, before we get going with... uh, this, I wanted to ask you a question. You have a lot of contacts, right?

#### ANDROMEDA:

I do. 

#### ATALANTA:

You wouldn’t happen to know anyone who “crossed the Lord of Erberus” or... We were told they might know something about the Fleece? 

#### ANDROMEDA:

Crossed the Lord of Erberus... I have an old friend who was headed to Planet Nine recently. I think she mentioned the fleece once? 

#### ATALANTA:

What did she say?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Not much. She just mentioned the time her buddy Jason roped her into hiding it from Medea. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE]

#### MEDEA:

Classic. 

#### ANDROMEDA:

I haven’t heard from her in a couple of weeks, but I could give you her last known coordinates. Her name’s Orpheus. 

#### ATALANTA:

Orpheus? I haven’t heard from her in years. I thought she settled down on Delphi?

#### ANDROMEDA:

She left a couple of weeks ago. Wouldn’t say why, but she sounded pretty upset last time she called. To be honest, I wouldn’t mind someone checking in on her.

#### MEDUSA:

If you want, we can send you a message when we find her?

#### ANDROMEDA:

No need. Just tell her to call me back. 

#### ATALANTA:

We’ll do that. Thank you, Andromeda. 

#### ECHO:

Alert, User Atalanta. A payment of 3,000 drachmas has been made to your account from User: Anonymous.

#### MEDEA:

That’d be our paycheck.

#### MEDUSA:

Isn’t it three in the morning? I didn’t think your boss would be up.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Yeah, Aristo’s always been a bit of a night owl. Likes the moonlight, she says. Though, given she lives on a spaceship, I’m pretty sure that’s meant to be a joke. 

#### MEDEA:

I don’t care when she pays us so long as she does.

#### ATALANTA:

I think we have a celebration to get back to, then.

#### ANDROMEDA:

How do we feel about a little music?

#### MEDUSA:

Again?

#### ANDROMEDA:

It comes with the package, short stuff. No getting out of it. Alright, then.

[SINGING] I once had a brother who showed me the way / Woh-oh, give me a sign! The reaper came knocking and snatched him away. / We’re soon to be off to Planet Nine!

##### [ATALANTA JOINS IN, THEN MEDEA AND MEDUSA]

##### [THEIR VOICES FADE AS A GUITAR INSTRUMENTAL OF “PLANET NINE” BEGINS]

#### MEDUSA (NARRATION):
Their smiles are infectious. Medea rolls her eyes, but she joins in, too.
I take a second to look at them. My crew, and a strange new friend. In this room, I’m a thread in a tapestry. My life has become woven with theirs, and they aren’t going to cut me off. Together, we’re creating something bigger. Something more beautiful. Something like a family.

There are a million things in this universe that could kill me. Rogue asteroids and airlock malfunctions or even myself, if I don’t start being more careful. But now, that’s all far away, kept at bay by the golden bubble of this moment and the copper walls of home. So I put the list aside, and I join with the others, and together our voices push the fear away.
