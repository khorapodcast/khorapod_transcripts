# __Wounds Ripped Open__

##### [CALMING LYRE MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### TALESPINNER:

Well, hey there! How’re you feeling? Oh, good! I’m glad you’re doing better. Oh— that doesn’t mean you have to talk! Obviously not. It’s just... nice to know, I guess.

And hey! I’ve got another story for you, if you want! [PAUSE] Great! Let’s get to it, shall we?

##### [SHE CLEARS HER THROAT]

#### TALESPINNER:

Sing, O Muses, of the stubborn, yet enduring Atalanta and her crew as she deals with more... personal issues, both past and present. Muses great, grant me the ability to sing to you the Hymn of Wounds Ripped Open.

##### [LYRE MUSIC ENDS]

##### [FLASHBACK. GRAVEL CRUNCHES UNDERNEATH FEET]

#### ATALANTA:

You know you didn’t have to stand up for me back there, right? I can handle a few pissy words, you don’t need to give them another reason to go off. It’s already iffy enough as is.

#### MELEAGER:

Yeah, yeah, I know, but--you shouldn’t have to deal with all that alone. If you want me to step back next time, though, just say the word. 

#### ATALANTA:

It’s just— frustrating, is all.

#### MELEAGER:

No, no, yeah. Those guys can be real mongrels when they want to be. How do you even stand them?

#### ATALANTA:

You get used to it. Besides. Not that different from taking on monsters, when you think about it. 

#### MELEAGER:

[SNORT OF LAUGHTER] You’re not wrong there. They’re mean, lazy, stupid— 

#### ATALANTA:
— and deserve a good spear to the jaw. 

#### MELEAGER:

I’m not burying yet another body for you. [MOCK DRAMATIC] This has gone too far, we’re in too deep!

#### ATALANTA:

Gasp! What, are you saying you wouldn’t defend me?

#### MELEAGER:

I- well, I never said that— 

#### ATALANTA:

Oh, woe is me! My only ally has betrayed me! Whoever will have my back now?

#### MELEAGER:

Pssh, you’re such a drama queen.

#### ATALANTA:

Aw, you know you love it.

#### MELEAGER:

Sometimes, I really wonder why I do.

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH AND SIGH]

#### ATALANTA:

Real talk, for just a sec. I’m glad you’re here with me. Don’t know what I’d do without you. 

#### MELEAGER:

Hey, I got you. I’m not going anywhere, okay? Can’t get away from me that easily. 

#### ATALANTA:

Thanks, Mel.

#### MELEAGER:

Well, unless it’s anywhere near a magnet. Then you’re on your own.

#### ATALANTA:

Oh shove off, you numpty. Not all of us can have some fancy cybernetic heart, you know.

#### MELEAGER:

What can I say? I’m the bane of metal detectors everywhere.

#### ATALANTA:

Alright, alright, that’s enough from you. [POMPOUS] Meleager the Steelhearted.

#### MELEAGER:

I will murder you!

#### ATALANTA:

Nah, you love me too much.

##### [MELEAGER’S PHONE BEEPS]

#### MELEAGER:

Oh! That’s Mum, I should probably check what she wants this time. 

##### [BEEP]

#### MELEAGER:

Oh… shoot. Hey, uh, ‘Lanta, check this out. [FOOTSTEPS, GRAVEL CRUNCHES]

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah? What’s up? ...Crikey. That is… a really big boar. Wait, that’s Calydon back there, right?

#### MELEAGER:

It’s... probably fine? Mum hasn’t sent the army out yet, so that’s probably a good sign. But, look here--they’ve put out a message to all the best warriors, calling them to Calydon. 

#### ATALANTA:

All the best warriors, huh? Sounds pretty competitive.

#### MELEAGER:

Yeah. Looks like it’s going to be a contest. There’s a solid gold trophy of the beast for whoever slays it.

#### ATALANTA:

You thinking what I’m thinking?

#### MELEAGER:

Atalanta.

#### ATALANTA:

C’mon, Mel. It’ll be fun!

#### MELEAGER:

And dangerous.

#### ATALANTA:

Still!

#### MELEAGER:

Atalanta, this is serious. You know what she’s like, there’s no way she’ll let me out there. You’re not going alone- that thing is the size of a space station, it’s gonna be really dangerous! Besides, wouldn’t want you to take all the glory.

#### ATALANTA:

Mel, hey, hey, listen to me, okay? It’ll be fine. Trust me on this one. Nothing bad’s gonna happen to us. I won’t let it.

#### MELEAGER:

You promise? 

#### ATALANTA:

Cross my heart.

##### [TREADMILL WHIRRING AND RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]

##### [ATALANTA BREATHES HEAVILY]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

It’s been a few days since we left Delos en route to Delphi, the races--and, hopefully, Orpheus. Echo’s been teaching Medusa how to steer, because apparently I shouldn’t be the only one who can handle the Argo. So I’ve been working out a lot to keep myself busy. Keep myself useful. Not a lot I really can do when my whole crew’s banned me from the pilot’s chair. 
Usually, I can go for a good while; an hour or so, maybe longer if I’m feeling particularly spry. But I’ve only been going for a little over half an hour when I realize something in my side… really hurts.

##### [TREADMILL SLOWS TO A STOP]

#### ATALANTA:

Huh, what...? Ow! Oh, right. Bloody cut! Honestly...

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

So, as it turns out, exercising when you have a kind-of-open, still-healing wound is actually not a very good idea. 

#### ATALANTA:

Gotta find Medea... no, what am I thinking? ...Already annoyed enough by the whole meds fiasco, no way I’m letting her know ‘bout it opening again... Already got it patched up twice! ...Med kit, med kit...

##### [SHUFFLING THROUGH SUPPLIES]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

I grab the pack— still in here from the last time I sprained an ankle— and rifle through. I didn’t realize how out of my depth I was with this stuff before Medea got here. This pack’s meager stash of pills and bandages is nothing compared to what I’ve seen her use. She may not be a doctor, but she’s the closest thing we have.

#### ATALANTA:

Echo, bandages help stab wounds, right?

#### ECHO:

Now showing results for: wound care. If you have a stab wound and bleeding occurs, cover it with a heavy bandage and apply firm direct pressure for 5 full minutes. If the bleeding does not stop, seek urgent medical care.

#### ATALANTA:

Well, great! I can do that. See, not completely useless. Thanks, Echo!

#### ECHO:

You are welcome, User: Atalanta. Should I contact User: Medea? I have her registered under: medical specialist, pharmaka expert, designated cook--

#### ATALANTA:

Nononono, that’s perfectly alright, thank you very much.

#### ECHO:

User: Atalanta. Your current bandages appear to be insufficient. You are bleeding.

#### ATALANTA:

...So I am! I’ll just... go look for the stronger ones, then! 

##### [FOOTSTEPS ON METAL]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

Most of the stuff in storage is old junk left behind by the former crew of the Argonauts, and most of ‘em didn’t think to double check that they’d packed everything. Lucky me, some of them left behind some decent bandages. I make for the portion of cabinets I know I’ve used before and start rummaging around. 

#### ATALANTA:

Alright, let’s take a gander at this. What’ve we got? Junk, junk, more junk, wristbands, even more junk, and— oh. Didn’t know this was still here.

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

The Calydonian Boar was far too big for a whole tusk to fit in a drawer, much less be taken by one person alone. So the queen of Calydonia instead awarded a shiny, golden trophy to whoever killed the thing. For the more avid hunters of our group to display.

I haven’t seen it in... Hell, years, maybe. Takes me back.

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

It’s not that I’ve been thinking about Meleager. In fact, I’ve actively been trying not to think about him. But with a new crew, with people I... can actually care about for once, I guess the comparison was inevitable, and seeing the tiny golden boar right there... it throws me back. Hard. Suddenly I’m remembering things I wish I’d forgotten a long time ago.

##### [FLASHBACK. THE RUMBLE OF AN ENGINE]

#### MELEAGER:

Come in. Repeat, come in Atalanta. 

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

We’d hardly had time to prepare before setting off to fight a planet-gouging boar. It was smaller than Calydon, but that didn’t mean much when its head was the size of a Theta-class— making our tiny Chi Fliers perfectly snack-sized. It had tusks like rocket-sized skewers, making cargo-ship kebab out of almost everyone who got in its way... Ordinarily creatures like that stick to deep space and exoplanets. They don’t really hunt, just kinda... graze on space junk. This one must have been desperate for food to be hanging out so close to civilization. 

Awful news for those of us who were trying to shoot ammo into its hide. We’d been firing at it for what felt like hours, and the beast didn’t even seem to feel it.

#### ANKAIOS:

[SPACESHIP GUN FIRES] Why’d we ever let the girl come along? She’s no pilot! That thing’ll tear her ship to pieces!

#### ATALANTA:

If you live through this I’ll shove your head so far--

#### ACAENUS:

Oh, that? Psh, I’ve killed things far more deadly than that pig! I’ll blast it no probl— 

##### [ACAENUS SCREAMS AND HIS SHIP GETS CRUSHED, CUT OFF BY STATIC.]

#### KEPHEUS:

Great. We lost Acaenus. What now?

#### ATALANTA:

We could try for one of the soft spots? The eyes are basically unguarded, other than the horns. Or I could try to fly inside and shoot at its insides until it dies?

#### ANKAIOS:

Who invited you?

#### ATALANTA:

Excuse me?!

#### MELEAGER:

Look, Atalanta has a point. Its hide is essentially invulnerable. We’ll have to be smart about where we attack.

#### KEPHEUS:

No offence, Meleager, but I thought that was obvious. Theseus, you fought a beast like this. What’s your plan? 

#### THESEUS:

Ah, the Crommyonian Sow. That was a hunt for the ages. Well, lads, back then I— 

##### [CLICK AS ATALANTA CHANGES CHANNELS]

#### ATALANTA:

Useless— Meleager. Do you hear me?

#### MELEAGER:

What a bunch of— I don’t know why they won’t listen to you, bunch of louts. But, really, Atalanta, inside it?

#### ATALANTA:

Look, it sounded like a good plan in my head-

#### MELEAGER:

Mmhm, like when you tried a singing contest with a siren?

#### ATALANTA:

That was one— look. Maybe it’s a bad plan— 

#### MELEAGER:

Understatement of the year.

#### ATALANTA:

— But we don’t have much to work with. What weapons does your flier have left?

#### MELEAGER:

Twelve rounds of ammo and two torpedoes.

#### ATALANTA:

Two harpoons left; out of ammunition on the main gun.

#### MELEAGER:

Damn. Definitely not a lot. Where do you think the best place to land a killing blow would be?

#### ATALANTA:

I think... if we hit it in its mouth, we could land a solid shot into its spine. Nobody’s managed to make a hit with anything punchy enough to break the skin. Maybe if I pull it to you, and you send your torpedoes there, we could have a chance.

##### [MUSIC BEGINS]

#### MELEAGER:

It’s the best plan we’ve got. Time to slay some monsters?

#### ATALANTA:

Always.

##### [CLICKS AS THEY EXIT THE COMMS CHANNEL. GUNS BLASTING]

#### ANKAIOS:

Woah, woah, where are you going? Didn’t you notice there’s a fight going on?

#### ATALANTA:

Just... distract it!

#### ANKAIOS:

[SCOOFS] Cowards. 

#### KEPHEUS:

Sure, and you all can just fly off and leave! Not like you were helping any.

#### MELEAGER:

Oh, shut up, Uncle, and do something useful for once in your life!

#### KEPHEUS:

Don’t talk to me like that.

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

I tuned them out then, focusing on the beast. I needed to find the best angle for my harpoons to land. Its large eye followed me, but I didn’t know what for. Was it bored? Just surveying like animals do? Or was the thing gonna make shish kebab out of me? It made no move to stop me until I flew closer than it wanted.

#### ATALANTA:

Come on, come on— whoa!

##### [SHE FLIES AWAY, THE BOAR ROARS AT HER]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

It started to turn its head towards me, enormous mouth opening, ready to bite. I slammed on the thrusters to get far away when I noticed its eye was wide open. I had a shot.

#### ATALANTA:

Come on... [BEEP] Gotcha!

[GUN BLAST] YES!

##### [THE BOAR ROARS]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

I pulled hard, only just slipping under one of the tusks as my engines strained to pull the beast’s head in place. [SPACESHIP WHIZZING] It opened wide, trying to swallow me whole. 

#### ATALANTA:

Come on, come on, come on...

#### MELEAGER:

I got it! Go go go!

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

I smashed the thrusters. My neck snapped to the side as they roared to life, and I almost blacked out from the force. The last thing I saw was the thing's teeth closing too fast around me. Its monstrous snout loomed above me, about to crush my fighter.

And then I saw Meleager’s final torpedoes shooting past me, into its open throat and through its skull. 

##### [GUNS FIRING. THE BOAR ROARS]

#### THESEUS:

By the stars...

#### MELEAGER:

Atalanta! 

#### ATALANTA:

It... it worked! It worked!

#### ANKAIOS:

He did it.

#### KEPHEUS:

Meleager, lad! You did it!

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

...but never mind all that. I shake off the memories, putting the trophy back in the drawer and exchanging it for the bandages. [SUPPLIES RATTLING, BANDAGES RIPPING] I patch up my wound as well as I can and go about my day. [FOOTSTEPS] Just think about anything else.

##### [DOOR OPENS]

#### ECHO:

[FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR] User: Medea. User: Atalanta is within 20 metres. 10 metres.

#### ATALANTA:

Oh! Uh, hi there. 

#### MEDEA:

Hello. 

#### ATALANTA:

Sorry, er, I thought Dusa was in here?

#### MEDEA:

They’re taking a break, went to the pantry to grab some fruit snacks— last I heard, they were planning on checking in with Andromeda too. And I wanted to spend some quality time with Echo up here. Watch the stars.

#### ATALANTA:

Oh. Well, I guess they’re making friends. That’s nice.

#### MEDEA:

What about you? Were you going to kick her out of the captain’s chair?

#### ATALANTA:

Uh, no, I just... really like it up here.

#### MEDEA:

Er... do you, you know, actually mean that, or is that...

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah, really, I do. I’ve probably slept in here more than in my actual quarters, in all the years I’ve lived on this ship. It’s cozy.

#### MEDEA:

[LAUGHS] Cozy? But the chairs are so... lumpy. And they don’t recline or anything. That can’t have been good on your back.

#### ATALANTA:

Well, I never said I mean to fall asleep. Just do a lot of late-night flying. Used to do a lot more, before...

#### MEDEA:

Let me guess. Before you had more company on the ship to keep you accountable?

#### ATALANTA:

[AWKWARD LAUGH] You got it. 

##### [SILENCE]

#### MEDEA:

Actually, I was wondering about that. I mean, I know you have Echo, but— how long has it been since you’ve had. You know. Actual humans on board?

ATALANTA:

Uh... I mean, properly? Not since the original Argo quest.

#### MEDEA:

Not since— Atalanta, that was years ago!

#### ATALANTA:

I know, I know, but... you know, there just weren’t many opportunities to look for people. Not like I can afford to pay them anything.

#### MEDEA:

Fine. Fair point. But then, what were you doing before the quest? Surely you haven’t been doing these... odd jobs your whole life.

#### ATALANTA:

Honestly? I kinda have. Used to be a mercenary. Went around hunting monsters.

#### MEDEA:

Can’t imagine you were that successful, considering how you took on that chimera.

#### ATALANTA:

Oh, har-de-har— [SHE HISSES IN PAIN]

#### MEDEA:

Atalanta? Are you okay?

#### ATALANTA:

I’m fine, fine, no need to worry.

#### MEDEA:

Show me that.

##### [FABRIC RUSTLES. ATALANTA GROANS]

#### MEDEA:

W— Atalanta.

#### ATALANTA:

Mm, yes?

#### MEDEA:

What the hell did you do.

#### ATALANTA:

I just bandaged it!

#### MEDEA:

And you needed to replace your bandages... why, exactly?

#### ATALANTA:

...uh.

#### MEDEA:

Were you resting, like I’d asked?

#### ATALANTA:

Well, I had been, but I got... bored?

#### MEDEA:

You got bored.

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah. I’d started feeling better, so I went to work out…?

#### MEDEA:

Of all the idiotic—! Come on, co-captain. Off to the medbay we go.

#### ATALANTA:

Fair enough.

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

The blood loss must be starting to catch up to me a little. As I follow Medea down the halls of the Argo on autopilot, my mind flashes back despite myself. Back to that day.

#### KEPHEUS:

So, Meleager, where are you putting the trophy? Should invest in a good shelf— authentic Gaian wood, maybe. Only the best for our hero.

#### MELEAGER:

Oh, actually, I was thinking Atalanta should have it. 

#### ATALANTA:

Aw, Mel, don’t worry about me.

#### KEPHEUS:

[STRAINED LAUGHTER] Ah, good joke, mate!

#### MELEAGER:

I’m serious. She did the work, after all. The only thing I did was kill it.

#### ANKAIOS:

You’re serious.

#### MELEAGER:

Without her, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity. It was teamwork.

#### THESEUS:

But it’s only right that you get the trophy! Jason, do you hear this?

#### ATALANTA:

Meleager, it’s fine. 

#### MELEAGER:

No, it’s not.

#### THESEUS:

Hah! Well, If you’re that eager to give it away, maybe I’ll just take it for myself!

#### KEPHEUS:

What?! No! You have enough as it is!

#### ANKAIOS:

If anything, I should take it. I landed several hits on its hide!

#### KEPHEUS:

And yet you didn’t puncture the skin. I did that. 

#### THESEUS:

You did nothing to aid the fight!

#### ATALANTA:

What, like you did?

#### THESEUS:

Oh, I’ll get you for that!

##### [GUNS BLASTING]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

It was full-on chaos. Chi fliers shooting at each other left and right, every man for himself. Well, Almost. Even then Mel had my back, us together against the world. 

##### [CLICKS AS SHE CHANGES THE COMMS CHANNEL]

#### ATALANTA:

Meleager, do you hear me?

#### MELEAGER:

Loud and clear. Stars, can you believe them?

#### ATALANTA:

...I’ll admit, I didn’t— I didnt expect them to be this violent.

#### MELEAGER:

Atalanta! On your left.

#### ATALANTA:

Thanks. [GUN BLAST] On your 7, Iolaus is trying to be clever.

#### MELEAGER:

Got it!

##### [SHOT]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

Chi fliers are built to be fast, punchy, and take a hit or two. Some of us had modifications built into ours, like Jason, who had added a large cannon to the top of his. Iolaus’s was built to favor speed, the Dioscuri had EMPs installed, and old man Peleus had so many tailored settings I don’t think his own son could figure out how to fly it. But I wasn’t thinking then. It was all on instinct.

#### MELEAGER:

Atalanta, Behind you! Kepheus!

#### ATALANTA:

Oh damn! Go left!

#### MELEAGER:

On it!

##### [SHIPS WHIZZING PAST]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

I twisted right, he veered left. And his last twelve rounds shredded Kepheus’s fighter like paper.

##### [BLAST. KEPHEUS YELLS OVER THE COMMS, CUT OFF BY STATIC]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

All at once, everything stopped. Even now, I don’t think any of us were really trying to kill each other. It just... well, all of us were mercenaries. We’d come here to slay a beast. Sometimes you forget... We all watched in silence, realising what we’d done. 

#### MELEAGER:

[STRUGGLING FOR WORDS, CHOKING UP] I’m so... oh, stars, I’m so sorry.

#### THESEUS:

Murderer!

#### ANKAIOS:

Calydon Central? There’s— Meleager just shot down Kepheus. What— what do we do?! [PAUSE] Disable the ship by any means possible, men! Bring the son of Calydon back, orders of the queen. Dioscuri, fire!

#### ATALANTA:

No!

##### [LOUD GUN BLAST. ELECTRICITY]

#### MELEAGER:

[HEAVY BREATHING] Oh, stars, it— !

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

The thing about an EMP is it won’t only hit one thing. Mel had talked about making improvements, safeguards, but... well. The pulse disabled his engines, his weaponry, and his electronic heart. [CHOKING UP] At least it took out the comms too. 

#### ATALANTA:

[STATIC] Meleager, can you hear me?! 

Please!

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

We all just made the return to Calydon in silence after that. Everyone was regretful, apologetic, and some of them even meant it. His mother the Queen offered to give me the trophy in his stead, so I took it, but... it wasn’t worth it, y’know? I... I put it in the storage bin and tried to forget that it all happened. So when I say that it’s only been Echo and myself for years, I mean that in all senses of the word. Echo was safe. She’s a NYMPH. Couldn’t die, or leave, or any of the many things that Medea and Medusa can. I know I— recruited Medea. Pushed for Medusa to stay. But growing attached to them, letting them help? I… I never planned for that.


#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

I’m snapped out of my spiraling by Medea as she practically drags me by my ear back to the medbay, a full length across the ship.

#### MEDUSA:

[DISTANT, GETTING CLOSER] You know how intestines still wriggle after they’re removed from the human body? No? ...Yeah, actually, I’m not surprised. Wow, I really didn’t think you’d be that grossed out— oh, Atalanta! Hi! What’s going on? Want an orange?

#### MEDEA:

What’s going on is that our dear co-captain opened her bloody swordfight wound again. 

#### ATALANTA:

Never mind that. What’re you two talking about? Thought you were off to grab some food?

#### MEDUSA:

Oh, stars! Uh, I got an orange, was on my way back and just telling Andromeda some medical facts from this book Medea found me? She says hi. And also, er, [ANDROMEDA IMPRESSION] “Really? Twice? That woman’s worse at keeping out of trouble than I am!”

#### ATALANTA:

Tell her that it’s no big deal. 

#### MEDEA:

Tell her that it is.

#### MEDUSA:

Er, can I help with anything? I can just end the call— 

#### MEDEA:

No, you don’t need to do that. I can manage perfectly well, don’t you worry. 

#### MEDUSA:

Are you sure you don’t want help? [BEAT] Or an orange? 

#### MEDEA:

I’ll make sure Echo lets you know if Atalanta attempts an escape. Or if we need any emergency citrus. 

#### ATALANTA:

Hey!

#### MEDUSA:

If you say so... [FOOTSTEPS. MEDUSA’S VOICE FADES AWAY] Okay, anyways. What were you saying about your dad? I’m giving you an out on the intestines talk, you know. Might wanna take it.

#### ATALANTA:

Rude. I’m letting you take me to medbay, aren’t I?

#### MEDEA:

Letting is a strong word. Remember this the next time you try and skip out on mandatory rest time.

#### ATALANTA:

If you say so...

#### MEDEA:

I do. Say so, I mean. Why are you so resistant to our help? I don’t understand it.

#### ATALANTA:

I’m not resistant, I just don’t need it.

#### MEDEA:

That’s not true and you know it. I can understand you not telling us about your back pain— to an extent— but... we wouldn’t have thought any less of you. You know that, right?

#### ATALANTA:

I... 

#### MEDEA:

Please. Atalanta. What could you possibly have to lose from telling us?

#### ATALANTA:

[SCOFFS] Well, you all, for one.

#### MEDEA:

I just said we wouldn’t leave you! 

#### ATALANTA:

What if I’m not enough and you get hurt because of it? It’d be all my fault. I can’t have that.

#### MEDEA:

Can’t have— Where is this coming from? Atalanta, that doesn’t make sense. 

#### ATALANTA:

It’s happened before, okay?! It can’t— if any of you— if you ended up dead because of this stupid quest that I forced you into— 

#### MEDEA:
You didn’t force us into anything! Have you never considered that maybe we don’t listen to you out of obligation, or just because you’re our captain? Maybe we actually care about you and want to help you, just like how you choose to help me— or Medusa, or Echo— because you care. It’s our choice, Atalanta, and you don’t get to make it for us just because you have too much of a hero complex to let anybody else save you for once. 

#### ATALANTA:

But— 

#### MEDEA:

But nothing. I'm taking you to the damn medbay, and you’re damn well going to lay down and rest your damn wound, and have a warm, calming bloody drink, until I deem it okay to walk, much less take a jaunt on the treadmill. Am I clear?

#### ATALANTA:

Yeah. Crystal.

#### MEDEA:

Good. Er, come on. 

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

Medea refuses to meet my eyes as we head to the medbay, which is standard, but after everything she said... I wouldn’t meet my eyes either if I were her. It’s not the first time she’s yelled at me— far from it— but it’s the first time it’s been... anything like that. I didn’t think— well. Didn’t expect it. It’s been a while since anyone’s been there for me like this. Probably why I have so many scars, for that matter. 

##### [DOOR OPENS]

#### MEDEA:

Here. Lay down on that cot.

#### ATALANTA:

You’re the boss.

##### [FABRIC RUSTLES]

#### MEDEA:

I’m either teaching you how to bandage yourself up properly or banning you from using them entirely. How did you even manage to mess it up this badly? 

#### ATALANTA:

What can I say? I have a gift.

#### MEDEA:

It’s not a good thing.

#### ATALANTA:

I know.

##### [ATALANTA’S THEME BEGINS]

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

Medea uses some medical doodad I’ve never managed to remember the name of to assess the damage, then cleanses it with a blend from one of her many, many bottles. She wraps it carefully, pulling no tighter than necessary. Her hands are so cold. I want to grab them, to return the favor. To help her in some pale imitation of the way she has, both knowingly and unknowingly, been helping me. It’s more than I can stand.

#### MEDEA:

Starting right now, you’re on bed rest. You are not going to do anything for at least a week. Yes, this means you will have to miss out on swashbuckling adventures. You’ll just have to deal with it. I’m not patching you up again. Here, take this.

##### [SHE FILLS A GLASS WITH LIQUID]

#### ATALANTA:

Thank you for the bandaging and all, but Medea, I really don’t need to—

#### MEDEA:

Just— take it. Please.

#### ATALANTA:

Alright. Only for you, I will care about my own well-being.

#### MEDEA:

[LAUGHS] Thank you.

#### ATALANTA (NARRATOR):

The drink is warm on my tongue, like rum and heather and honey, and— ugh, fiery, too. One of its medicinal ingredients must be booze. I think— I’ve had one before, years ago, on Colchis. Pain is bloody exhausting. I’ve learned that much over the years, and between my bandages and my memories I’ve had two wounds ripped open today— but Medea’s potion burns in my throat; its sweetness helps a little to numb the pain in my stab wound, and my back, and my heart. As I drift out of consciousness, I can hear Medea humming beside me.
