# __Uninvited Attention__

#### A.L. EMMET:

Hello, listeners. This is your friendly producer, A.L. Emmet, here with a few announcements at the top of the episode. Don’t worry, I’ll make it quick. First off, episode 9 marks the midway point in season one. As such, in order to make the half of the season as good as we can get it, we’ll be taking a mid-season break through the summer. The beginning of the end will be coming to you in August 2021. 

Secondly, if you’ve been enjoying Khôra and want to show your support, we now have a tip jar! You can find us on Paypal or Kofi as khorapodcast and I’ll put links to those in the shownotes. Any money sent to us will go directly to making Khôra better and supporting production through the end of the season. We so appreciate your support, whether through the tip jar or just by listening and sharing the show. We couldn’t do it without you.

Lastly, if you have a podcast and want to arrange a cross-promotion with us, drop us a line on social media or email us at khorapodcast@gmail.com. We’d love to hear from you. Today, we have a few words from our friends at Sea Captains and Cog Creatures, a comedy D&D podcast. Enjoy the show.

#### SEA CAPTAINS AND COG CREATURES TRAILER:

Do you like D&D? Do you like comedy? Do you like pirates? Well, we on the vessel of the S.S. Mars have the podcast for you! It’s called Sea Captains and Cog Creatures, a podcast created by tired teens in quarantine... Now partial quarantine. You can find us on Anchor, Spotify, Pocketcast, Radiopublic, and Overcast. Now, where did I put those dice? [DICE SPILL] Crap.

##### [CALMING LYRE MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### TALESPINNER:

The story for today is, well, a little darker, I guess. In every epic, there’s moments of downfall— it’s what makes it so much more satisfying to see the heroes get back up, I think. That’s where we are now, the two of us, in a downer moment of our lives’ narrative. I, like, totally get it if you wanna listen to something happier. Using tragedy as a distraction from a different tragedy can be, well… a little ineffective, I guess?

#### TALESPINNER:

You… still want to listen? Alright, but if it gets too much, you can tap out. I don’t wanna, like, upset you or anything. [BEAT] Right. Okay.

Sing, O Muses, of the persevering Medea who, without Atalanta by her and Medusa’s side, must trek through the chaos of a competition turned deadly in hopes of finding the great Orpheus. Muses Great, grant me the ability to sing to you the Hymn of Uninvited Attention.

##### [LYRE MUSIC ENDS]

##### [DISTANT UPBEAT MUSIC. PEOPLE HOOTING AND CHATTING]

#### ANNOUNCER:

Wow! What a crowd we’ve got going today! Keep that energy up— Apollo hasn’t even made his entrance yet, folks!

#### MEDEA:

Eughhh— it’s too much. It’s just too much.

#### MEDUSA:

Ugh, stars— why did all these people shell out for this? This is fun for them?

#### MEDEA:

[GRUMBLING] I don’t know.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

There is far too much going on in my mind right now, but I can focus on three clear thoughts alongside the overstimulation. One, the crowd’s cheers and the music blaring over the arena speakers feel like they’re turning my brain into mush. Two, I know I’m the person who told Atalanta to take a break from the action to recover, but I’m regretting that decision with every damn second we’re in this crowd. Three, I am dealing with all this while wearing an Apollo TV-approved carnival mask advertising my very favourite podship racer: Orpheus. 

[SIGH] Stars, I never thought I’d catch myself saying I miss Atalanta.

##### [RADIO CRACKLES]

#### MEDEA:

You there? Hello?

#### MEDEA:

Damn static.

##### [SHE SHUTS IT OFF]

#### MEDUSA:

Can you hear her?

#### MEDEA:

Not a word. Something’s going wrong with the signal.

#### MEDUSA:

[DEEP BREATH] Okay. Okay. Step one. Find Orpheus.

#### MEDEA:

You’d have thought getting meet-and-greet passes and decking ourselves out in her merch might have helped.

#### MEDUSA:

She was supposed to be here! The pass entitles us to an exclusive chance for twenty seconds of facetime with all our fabulous racers!

#### MEDEA:

I genuinely will not be able to do this much– Oi, quit trying to skip the line! 

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

Medusa tugs furiously at the zipper of her coat as we try to weave through the crowd, sliding it up and down and up again. I try to go through all the ways I know to calm myself. Uninvited attention is the last thing we need right now, and if I start humming or swaying that’s exactly what we’ll get. Instead, I focus on my shirt. The feeling of the soft woven cloth as it sits over my shoulders and flows around me. The slight coolness of where the metal detailing brushes against my skin. I think of how, if I wanted to, I could rub it between my fingers and feel its smoothness. With this to ground me, I try to pay attention to the direction we’re walking and I try to ignore the hotness and discomfort of throngs of people surrounding me. Focus, Medea. Breathe. You just have to carry yourself through this crowd.

#### FANGIRL:

OH MY STARS! LOOK, THEY’RE RIGHT OVER THERE! 

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

It’s just all too bloody much. The chaos around me still feels like sandpaper inside my skull, and the prospect of just looking around isn’t one I look forward to, but the sooner that we find Orpheus, the sooner we can get out of here.

#### MEDUSA:

This. Sucks.

#### MEDEA:

You know, you could take off your coat if you’re hot.

###### MEDUSA:

No, no, no, no, no, no thank you! Let’s try the radio again. Maybe it will work better in here. 

##### [MORE STATIC]

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

Can you guys hear me? Is anyone there? 

#### MEDEA:

Sorry, the radios weren’t working. 

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

That’s all right, love. Did you get in?

#### MEDEA:

The passes worked like a charm. We’re backstage now... Where are we going?

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

I don’t know. I haven’t talked to Orpheus in years. Just look around, okay? See if you can find--

##### [STATIC CRACKLES]

#### MEDEA:

Atalanta? Right. Looks like we’re on our own for a bit, kid.

#### MEDUSA:

[SIGH] Okay. We can do that.

#### MEDEA:

Over there. PA bot. They might know.

#### MEDUSA:

P... PA bot? Like an AI? Won’t they be like–

#### MEDEA:

Just ask. It’s fine.

#### MEDUSA:

Um, excuse me, Mx. Have you seen Orpheus?

#### PA BOT:

I’m sorry. I am unable to help you at this moment.

#### MEDUSA:

I just had— and they’re gone. 

#### MEDEA:

Okay. Okay! We just need to try someone else. Uhh, you.

#### HIPPOMENES:

Me?

#### MEDEA:

You. Have you seen Orpheus?

#### HIPPOMENES:

Orpheus… don’t think so, no— not in a while. I think I heard something about a vacation?

#### MEDUSA:

Vacation to where?

#### HIPPOMENES:

Beats me. But hey, I’m here. I’ll be racing in a minute. Do you ladies care to watch the race from my box?

#### MEDEA:

No. No, thank you. Just— bye.

#### ATALANTA:

Stars, that wasn’t Hippomenes, was it?

#### MEDEA:

According to the very sparkly custom jacket, yes, it was. Why?

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

Ugh, that guy cheats at everything. I had a run-in with him once. Bet he’s gonna pull something.

##### [MUSIC GETS LOUDER AND MORE UPBEAT]

#### MEDEA:

Augh!!

#### MEDUSA:

Stars, do they have to do that?

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

Are you okay?

#### MEDEA:

I hate this. 

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

Breathe, okay? 

#### MEDEA:

I’m fine. Let’s just keep looking. 

#### MEDUSA:

Do you need--

#### MEDEA:

I’m fine. Let’s just get this done. 

#### ATALANTA (RADIO):

It sounds like a lot in there. If you need to take a break, you can probably go find— 

##### [STATIC]

#### MEDEA:

Damn it. Atalanta!

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

It’s useless. I can’t reach her, and the tinny music and cheering crowd are still blaring through the speakers, and no one knows anything. Why are we even here?

#### MEDUSA:

We could ask someone else if they--

#### MEDEA:

No, just be quiet! Stop!

#### MEDUSA:

[SURPRISED INHALE] I— I’m so sorry. It won’t happen again. 

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

If it’s possible, they’ve made themself smaller, like they’re trying to disappear into that coat. Under their scarf, I can see the anxious twitching of wires. 

#### MEDEA:

I— I’m sorry, Medusa. I didn’t mean to snap at you. Can we try to find somewhere—

#### APOLLO (OVER SPEAKERS):

It’s your lovely host Apollo here reminding all of our guests that the betting stands are now open!

#### MEDEA:

Oh, I’m done with this! That music is so loud I can taste it, and clearly nobody here cares about Orpheus, let’s just go!

#### MEDUSA:

I— I—

#### MEDEA:

[GROANS] I’m sorry but I can't tell if that's a yes or a no and it's too loud and I just...

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Pardon for interrupting and feel free to tell me to bug off if I’m unwanted, but the two of you look like you’ve had better days. Do you need any help?

#### MEDEA:

It’s just. Loud.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Do you need a quiet place? 

#### MEDEA:

That would be helpful, yes.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Come with me. My dressing room is much quieter. Oh, stars, that totally sounded like a line. It wasn’t, I promise.

#### MEDUSA:

Don’t worry, I knew what you meant. Are you alright with this?

#### MEDEA:

Yeah. Yeah, I am.

#### MEDUSA:

If it wouldn’t be too much trouble, we would like that. 

#### ASCLEPIUS:

It’s this way. Not far from here. 

#### MEDUSA:

[GASP] You’re Asclepius! We’re looking for someone. Have you seen— 

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Sure am! But your friend here looks like they really need to leave. Shall we?

#### MEDUSA:

Sorry! Sorry, of course!

##### [FOOTSTEPS. MUSIC FADES OUT]

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Come on now, I have a gorgeously comfortable kline in here. If there’s one benefit to celebrity, it’s gotta be the nice furniture.

#### MEDEA:

[MUMBLING] Mhm. Yeah, thanks.

#### ASCLEPIUS:
And you can take that mask off, it’s clearly bothering you.

#### MEDUSA:

They’re right, you’ve been pawing at it the whole time, Medea.

##### [ASCLEPIUS GASPS. A TENSE BEAT]

#### ASCLEPIUS:

...Medea?

#### MEDEA:

Hello. 

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Medea…? Stars, is that really you? It’s been, what, ten years?

#### MEDEA:

Somewhere around that.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

How are you not in— no— I’m sorry, this is certainly a wild way to reconnect with the woman who murdered your captain!

#### MEDEA:

We don’t have time for this right now.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

We don’t? No, I simply… What are you… You’re just waltzing around free as a bird and meeting celebrities now?

#### MEDEA:

It’s not what you think. We’re in danger right now, we don’t have time to–

#### ASCLEPIUS:

You’re in danger?! Medea, you are the danger!

#### MEDEA:

Oh, get over yourself! I’m unarmed and overwhelmed and I just need someone to help.

#### MEDUSA:

You said you’d help us.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

That’s when I thought you were just two fans having a rough time in the crowd. This is not the same thing!

#### MEDUSA:

Please?

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Don’t you know who she is?

#### MEDEA:

You could talk about me sometime when I’m not ten feet away perhaps.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

Hearing Asclepius’s utter loathing for me… stung, to be honest. On the Argo, there were very few of us who weren’t men and, well, we treated each other better than the guys treated us. They made fewer… comments about me, at the very least. The person in front of me, face caked in gaudy, glittering makeup was one of them. They were always a welcome face back then. I can’t say I really had friends back on the Argo, but I had liked them. They knew Jason and, by extension, they liked me. I haven’t seen them since, save for on a TV screen. But, unlike my encounter with Heracles, there’s no shield of idiocy to protect me from them. I’m laid bare and vulnerable in front of them: they know exactly who I am and what I’ve done... I wouldn’t be keen on helping me either. [SIGH] But we need them to do it.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Look, dearie, you seem like a very sweet kid, and I would still love to help you out with what I intended to help with. [DEEP BREATH] You can take these noise pods to help block out the loud sounds, but you two need to leave. And I recommend you try to leave— she is not your friend! Or at least she won’t be when her knife is in your back and your body’s out the airlock.

#### MEDEA:

Listen, I don’t want to be here either, okay? We’re looking for Orpheus. Or anybody who knows where she is.

##### [A very tense beat. ASCLEPIUS sighs.]

#### ASCLEPIUS:

You’re a smart woman, Medea, we both know this. You’ve managed to avoid prison for this long, so really, why are you risking it all to be here? Orpheus can’t be that important. [BEAT] All I’m saying is that an Olympian’s playground doesn’t seem like a suitable place for a wanted criminal at all, does it? Unless said criminal has a pretty little death wish, which some of us may be more or less reluctantly willing to… indulge.

#### MEDEA:

I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important.

##### [KNOCKING]

#### SECURITY GUARD:
Mx. Asclepius, ma’am, there’s no taking guests into private dressing rooms without supervision. Mr. Apollo was very clear in his instructions. Safety issue.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

[FLIPPING INTO A PERSONA] Of course. My bad— absentminded professor, that damned Asclepius. A real genius but they’d forget their own head if it wasn’t attached! [LAUGHS] Could you be a dear and give us a minute? It’s just two charming fans.

#### SECURITY GUARD:

[GRUNTS]

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Thank you, darling!

##### [DOOR CLOSES]

#### MEDEA:

Now that’s an act.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

That’s showbiz. [BEAT] Why are you hunting Orpheus?

#### MEDUSA:

We’re friends of a friend. She was worried about her, and thought she might know something about the— 

#### MEDEA:

Wheesht! They’re with Olympus Corp, they can’t know.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Oh please, if you think I’d snitch to that little piece of—

##### [DOOR OPENS]

#### SECURITY GUARD:

Mx. Asclepius, your door isn’t allowed to be shut.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Oops!

#### SECURITY GUARD:

No problem, just continue business as usual. Like I’m not even here.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

So sorry about that little mishap! Rules here are always changing, that Apollo sure does love to prevent any liabilities from hitting him or us. Anyway, this is the backstage area, where all the racers prepare. Usually the real hair and makeup work is done in our private rooms, but the backstage is where we all convene and relax before and after the big race.

#### MEDUSA:

...Uh huh.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

So, you guys are fans of Orpheus, hm? She’s a real star, that one. Shame she’s on a vacation break now... Apollo never lets us take vacations like this, wonder how she pulled it off.

#### MEDEA:

You don’t get to save up vacation time? Thought big shots like you got all of the nice perks.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

It’s in our contracts. Our fans rely on us, after all, haha! It really is tragic, not getting to see your favorite racer. I would love to help you get in contact sometime so you know when she gets back! I can keep you updated if you give me means to contact you.

#### MEDEA:

My comms are clogged enough as is. And Medusa’s are worse.

#### DAPHNE (OVER SPEAKERS):

Ten minutes until the race begins! If you aren’t wearing a t-shirt to support your favorite contestant, then what are you doing? Show your support and buy one now!

#### MEDUSA:

That’s—

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Anyway, since you’re both such big fans, how about an autograph, hm?

#### MEDUSA:

Oh, I don’t really know if that’s necessary.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Oh no, please, I insist! You’ve come such a long way to see the race, after all, I wouldn’t want you to go home empty-handed. 

#### MEDEA:

If I agree, can we go?

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Oh, you’re so funny! I understand— some fans like to play it cool when they’re starstruck. Pity Orpheus isn’t here— I know a lot of fans are probably disappointed about not seeing her today. Ah, c’est la vie, I suppose. Here you are. [KISSES THE PAPER] Lipstick print and all.

#### MEDEA:

Thanks.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Enjoy the race. Keep that autograph close to you.

#### MEDEA:

If I had a drachma for every time a stupid former Argonaut left me with a useless autograph instead of the information I needed, I’d have— 

#### MEDUSA:

Wait, hold on. Did you actually take a look at that autograph?

#### MEDEA:

No. I was annoyed and saw no need to.

#### MEDUSA:

Well, it isn’t an autograph at all. It’s a note.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

Sure enough, she was right. Written in their glittery ink were the words, “I think I know what happened to Orpheus. Meet me after the show in one of my private rooms,” signed with their name and a trademarked lipstick print. Slipped in with it was… a room key, presumably to their dressing room. It… wasn’t much, but it was more than we were likely to get anywhere else.

#### MEDUSA:

Does that mean we have to stay through the whole race?

#### MEDEA:

[DEEP SIGH] Yes. Unfortunately, it does.

##### [ROAR OF THE CROWD]

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

We head to the actual race itself. Everything about this area of Delphi, about the Pythian cup seeps opulence. Apollo has a lot of money to spend and he knows exactly where to spend it, on twisting racetracks and wild obstacles floating above the violet surface. It’s… flashy for sure, but it’s breathtaking. 

#### USHER:

Orpheus fans, huh? This break must suck for you guys. Ah, well, who are you replacing her with today? 

#### MEDEA:

Asclepius. [BEAT] Please.

#### USHER:

Sure thing— we’ve got some extra high class seats in their section today. You’ll get a real nice view and everything. It’s just right down there, seats Gamma 31 and 32. Enjoy the race, ladies!

#### MEDUSA:

Thank you!
##### [THEY SIT]

#### MEDUSA:

At least it’s a little bit quieter in here?

#### MEDEA:

Yes, and all of the pretty flashing lights sure try to make up for it. Atalanta would love this.

#### MEDUSA:

You miss her right now, don’t you?

#### MEDEA:

Who?

#### MEDUSA:

Atalanta.

#### MEDEA:

[HUMS IN THOUGHT] Well, right now, I miss having somebody who can handle a loud crowded place without feeling like they’re dying. So, fine. I suppose I miss her if that’s what you mean. [BEAT. A FOND LAUGH] This kind of thing is exactly her style, isn’t it? She’d probably be decked out in all of this stupid merch. I wonder if she’s listening to me and staying in bed or if her stupid, restless self is up exercising again. Should I check in?

#### MEDUSA:

I think she’s too afraid of earning your ire again. You nearly ripped her head off when you found out about her reinjuring herself.

#### DAPHNE (OVER SPEAKERS):

Everybody get settled, the race is starting in just two minutes! I wanna see high energy! Roaring cheers! Let your favorite contestants know how much you adore them!

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

The screens in the box change from the flashy Pythian Cup logo to several camera feeds: Of the track, of the inside of a cockpit, and then of Asclepius’s smiling face as they wave to their eagerly watching fans. The other boxes in the stadium are draped in the colours of the different racers. Each visible on scores of screens, each in their own campy outfits and personas, waving and blowing kisses to their adoring fans. While the actual Pythian cup was fun to watch for those of us who like a good race, what really keeps the fans coming in is the performance and commentary of their racer of choice. It’s nice to see your favorite win, of course, but it’s always more important that they put on an entertaining show. Consequently, Apollo more or less owns his racers. 

##### [PYTHIAN CUP JINGLE]

#### DAPHNE (OVER SPEAKERS):

Helloooooo! This is everyone’s favorite AI here to explain the rules of the race.

#### MEDUSA:

He’s still using her voice. All of this and he’s still using her.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

As this bastardized pre recording of DAPHNE continues her introduction, I can feel Medusa next to me shaking in anger, balling their fists up.

#### DAPHNE (OVER SPEAKERS):

Each racer will speed through this brand-new, super-thrilling track, [CROWD “WHOA”S] each using everything they can– wits, weapons and dirty tricks– to get ahead! No holds barred! Electrifying drama! Hair-raising competition! All brought live to you by our incredibly charming host… Olympus Corporation’s finest… Apollo! And here he is!

##### [CROWD ROARING AND WHISTLING]

#### MEDUSA:

I'm going to deck him. It’s not even the real DAPHNE and they just don’t care! He’s just still using her voice and image like he didn’t do all of this horrible stuff to her.

#### MEDEA:

I’m... I’m sorry.

#### MEDUSA:

I just… I just want her to have a break. She still can’t be free. Not like this.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

And there he is, right before the crowd with golden hair and sunkissed skin, wearing a ludicrously elaborate shimmering jumpsuit that was probably valued at more than a small moon. Everything about his appearance was pristine and extravagant and golden. As if he’d captured the essence of all of the galaxies’ suns.

That was the motto of any Olympian— to be the biggest, the most extravagant, the wealthiest. Apollo, artist that he was, put all of that largesse and extravagance and, well, wealth into his appearance.

#### APOLLO:

Welcome, darlings, to the Pythian Cup! What a crowd we’ve got going today— I am LOVING the energy! Today’s track is a tough one, that’s for certain. We’ve got it all— gorgeous suspended twisting roads and, alongside our classic favs, I’ve added some brand new obstacles for you! These ones are more dangerous than ever seen before— the giant axes of Phoebus! [CLAPPING] But that’s enough of that! Let’s introduce today’s racers! In lane 1, we’ve got the incredible Phoebe! Isn’t she gorgeous? In lane 2, the shining Ion— don’t be jealous, that hair is a wig, dolls. Thirdly, we have the ever cunning and magnificent Asclepius! Fourthly, Coronus! In lane number 5, we have Hippomenes! Give it up for Linos, Syrus, Aristaeus, and Lykoras in lanes 7-9! And our final 4 racers: a big round of applause for Branchus, Delphus, Doros, and Chariclo! Today’s race is sponsored by Bacchus Wines and Spirits! For a good time, drink Bacchus Wine!

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Hello, my dears! I hope you’re having fun tuning in in your little boxes— you’ve chosen a great one for today! As you know, I’m the one and only Asclepius! Today I’m sponsored by Akestor Medical, the best medical care under the suns! It’s such an honor to be racing today for you all. 

#### DAPHNE (OVER SPEAKERS):

Racers, start your engines! In 3… 2… 1… GO!

##### [UPBEAT MUSIC BEGINS]

#### ASCLEPIUS:

We’ve got a pretty decent start now, don’t we? To absolutely no one’s surprise, Hippomenes managed to start pretty far ahead. Total cheat, don’t you think, my dears? [LAUGH] You’d think with all that cheating, he’d manage to snag a win or two, no?

#### MEDEA:

Atalanta was right then.

#### MEDUSA:

I guess so.

#### ASCLEPIUS:

I have to say, Apollo sure did a stellar job making this track difficult. These swerves are way harder than normal. We haven’t done a winding, floating track like this in a hot minute. Oh well! Who doesn’t love a little challenge, hm? Nothing your local genius can’t handle, right?
Coming up on some of his new exciting obstacles! Would you take a look at those axes? They’re certainly the real deal. Frightening to look at, don’t you think? They’d rip the wings right off this thing! I think that’s Ion up there attempting it now.

##### [METAL CRASHING]

#### ASCLEPIUS:

Swinging down like that— just sweeping him out! Come on Ion, surely you can brush it off like a big boy! [LAUGHING, WHICH DIES OUT QUICKLY] Stars. He— uh— isn’t moving. This crash looks serious. I’m gonna, um, pull off to check on him.

##### [BEAT]

Stop the race! Stars, stop the race! Ion is seriously injured— can we get a team of medics? I have medical training but it’s not enough– I don’t have supplies– I don’t have anything. Stars, can we get some help— can we PLEASE get some help?

##### [STATIC]

#### APOLLO:

Oh no! What a horrible mishap! Asclepius’s feed seems to be cutting out! Silly little technical difficulties, how unfortunate! No worries— you guys get the privilege of getting to hear your commentary straight from the host!

How exciting! Asclepius has the chance to take a clear lead with the advantage of Ion’s crash! But… they aren’t taking it? Why aren’t they taking it? How stupid! They’re flying up to Ion to help him! Very strange behavior from Asclepius today, viewers!

#### MEDEA:

Why isn’t anyone helping them? That axe thing could genuinely kill somebody— why hasn’t Apollo stopped the race?

#### MEDUSA:

I think he knows how dangerous it is, Medea.

#### APOLLO:

Asclepius still isn’t getting out of the way!

#### ASCLEPIUS:

[CUTTING IN AND OUT WITH STATIC] I need another doctor! We need paramedics here! Please!

#### APOLLO:

How bizarre! More technical difficulties! We really must get this silly feed fixed. More importantly, Asclepius really must get out of the way soon! Don’t they know how dangerous those giant axes are? It’ll take them out too! How curious. Really makes you ask big questions about human nature, doesn’t it? Are we willing to put ourselves in harm’s way, forgoing glory and money, to save one of our fellow men? Or do we carry forth to victory? Asclepius is a curious creature indeed! Putting themselves in such danger! Look at that! It’s going to kill them both! That giant axe is going to swing down in 3… 2… 1!

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

I close my eyes before the countdown finishes. I don’t need to see what transpires: the giant, metal axe, Pythian cup logo glimmering gold on its side, descending onto the already downed Ion, and onto Asclepius, who… who was just trying to help. I feel like I’m going to be sick. I clutch the little lilac piece of paper in my pocket with their trademark lipstick print. The last one they would ever leave. I want to go home. To the Argo, to Circe, to Colchis, to… To anywhere but here.

#### MEDEA:

[JUMPS] Ah— What! [BEAT] Sorry.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

Medusa places a soft, warm hand on my shoulder.

I feel hollow, and I can't move, as if the shock has literally frozen me into place. 

#### MEDUSA:

Are you alright?

#### MEDEA:

As alright as I can be having just watched two people die in front of me.

#### MEDUSA:

So, you think they’re really… dead?

#### MEDEA:

Crash like that, they have to be. I think Apollo did nothing to stop it. Like... like he knew.

#### MEDUSA:

I hate him.

#### APOLLO:

Look at this! How excellent! Coronus has taken perfect advantage of the other racers’ distractions and has zipped right into a massive lead!

MEDUSA:

Medea, we need… We really need to go.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

The smoking wreckage of the crash is still sitting there and I cannot stop looking at it. They’re in there, and the other racers are just flying past it all. I’m no stranger to death, but I feel sickened nonetheless. I close my eyes and… there all of it is. Asclepius… The urgency behind their plastic smile… and then him… and that phantom feeling of warm blood on my hands.

#### MEDEA:

I... I just want to get out of here. I feel. Ill. This whole place is making me feel. Ill.

#### MEDUSA:

Yeah. Me too.

#### APOLLO (OVER SPEAKERS):

I don’t think the others will be able to recover in the time left.

#### MEDUSA:

Oh, would you shut up already? [BEAT] Not you.

#### MEDEA:

I know. I’m going to... check in with Atalanta.

#### MEDUSA:

We can do it when we find somewhere to rest, okay? I’m going to try to erase our names and footage from this place. I don’t know if we’re recognizable or if Apollo would try to find us. I… don’t know how much he’s going to want to cover this all up.

#### MEDEA:

That’s smart.

##### [BEAT]

#### MEDUSA:

You okay to leave?

#### MEDEA:

...Yes.

#### MEDUSA:

Come on. 

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

We weave our way out of the still-cheering crowd under the pretense of finding some snacks until we wind up in one of the hallways, close to where Asclepius’ dressing room is.

#### MEDEA:

[COMMS BEEP] Am I coming in clear?

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

You’re absolutely crystal, love. What can I do for you?

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

I can hear the smile in her voice.  It isn’t hard to imagine her waiting with anticipation for the comms to beep so she can answer so brightly. And now I feel absolutely racked with guilt about the fact that I’m going to be responsible for wiping that smile clean off her face.

#### MEDEA:

We— We just left the race.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

I wish I could’ve been there! How’d it go? Did you find anything?

#### MEDEA:

We originally had a lead with Asclepius, um... They told us to meet them in their dressing room after the race.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Originally? Did something happen?

#### MEDEA:

There was… an awful accident. An obstacle, uh, came down. Giant axe. Knocked out one of the racers— Ion, I think. Asclepius tried to help but it. Uh. It got them too.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

[SILENCE] Stars… I… the Pythian Cup has been dangerous before, yeah, but it’s not normally... lethal. I don’t think, at least. I mean racers get hurt, yeah, but they usually test all the obstacles to make sure they aren’t deadly.

#### MEDEA:

Well, they didn’t test this one enough, I guess.

##### [BEAT]

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

How are you holding up?

#### MEDEA:

Well, we’re out of a lead now and I have no idea how we’re going to find Orpheus and even less of an idea— 

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

I’m not talking about the mission, Medea. Emotionally, how are you holding up?

#### MEDEA:

Don’t start caring about me now, softie.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

You just watched someone die in front of you. I’m going to want to check in.

#### MEDEA:

I closed my eyes before the crash, so I didn’t watch it exactly.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Oh, you know what I mean! I’m trying to ask how you feel.

#### MEDEA:

Since when were you some kind of expert in emotions?

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Oi! You’re the one who calls me denser than concrete, I think emotional intelligence is the only kind you’ll allow me to have.

#### MEDEA:

[SMALL CHUCKLE] I can’t lie to you, can I?

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

You can, but I don’t think I’d buy it.

##### [BEAT]

#### MEDEA:

Um... It feels. Bad. Really, really bad. I don’t know how else to describe it but it’s…

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Bad?

#### MEDEA:

[DEEP BREATH] Yeah. Bad. [BEAT] After it happened, I just… couldn’t focus on anything else about the race. The worst part was that no one else in the audience seemed to care at all. I mean. A few people did, I think? I— I don’t know. We just had to leave.

#### MEDEA:

I… I can’t get it out of my head, Atalanta. They were— they were just trying to help.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

I know. I’m… sorry.

#### MEDEA:

I’m just trying to finish this mission now so that we can get out of here.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

What’s the plan?

#### MEDEA:

Medusa’s working on wiping our existence from this place. We have Asclepius’s room key— they gave it to us before the race, so um... If they planned on telling us about Orpheus like they said, they might have left something behind in there.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Solid next step. It’s like you don’t even need me as a captain! How’s our hacker?

#### MEDEA:

Let me check in on her. Medusa, status report on the data erasure?

#### MEDUSA:

It’s like we were never here.

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Gorgeous! What d’ya say? Got the energy for a heist in you today?

#### MEDEA:

Do I have a choice?

#### ATALANTA (OVER RADIO):

Not particularly. But it’s much better when we’ve got an energetic band of thieves.

#### MEDUSA:

I think we’ll be fine.

#### ATALANTA:

Well, that’s one kind of energy. I’ll take it!

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):
The heist should have been so simple. The kind of thing that goes off without a hitch. We have the key; the place is empty. Well, it should be empty.

#### ???:

Dammit! Stars, why can’t I get this thing open?

#### MEDUSA (quietly):

There’s someone there. They’re probably OlympusCorp.  

I can paralyse them.

#### MEDEA:

Okay. Right. Get the bastard. 

##### [WIRES BUZZ WITH ELECTRICITY]

#### ANDROMEDA:

Agh! I’m not suspicious!

#### MEDUSA:

Andromeda? You— you scared me— I almost got you with my wires there! What are you doing here?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Would you believe me if I said nothing important?

#### MEDUSA:

[AMUSED HUFF] Not for a second.

#### MEDEA:

That’s Orpheus’s dressing room. Are you trying to break in?

#### ANDROMEDA:

I would be succeeding if Apollo didn’t do such a weirdly good security job. It’s a dressing room, for stars’ sake! I just… I wanted answers, okay? I was getting more worried and I just felt weird waiting for someone’s call when I could check it out for myself, y’know?

#### MEDEA:

Well, it looks like you were doing a terrible job at breaking in. A magnet and a hairpin will do very little against OlympusCorp tech. I would expect more from some great pirate, you know.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Listen! It’s more complex than that, okay? I had a plan. Always do after all. [TONGUE CLICK]

#### MEDUSA:

It doesn’t matter. We have the room key for one of the dressing rooms here. At the very least, we can get into Asclepius’ room.

##### [DOOR BEEPS AND OPENS]

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

It’s… odd, being in the room of someone so freshly dead. The room itself still feels like there’s life in it, half-finished. It’s almost a game, trying to figure out what they were thinking— where they would put something that they wanted to show later.
I have to search through the mind of Asclepius. Asclepius who had hated me for… fair reasons that I couldn’t run from. For the blood on my hands. But… stars, I knew them, all that time ago on the Argo. They were interested in medicine, I remember. We talked late at night in the med bay about the best way to treat some of the crew’s wounds and ailments. I had— [CHOKING UP] I had always appreciated the extra set of hands. I had almost forgotten about all of those little conversations before now. And now they’re all echoing inside of my head.

##### [CLOTHES RUSTLING]

#### ANDROMEDA:

Any idea where they’d put stuff? It looks like just a bunch of sparkly drag costumes here.

#### MEDEA (NARRATION):

There isn’t… much in their room at all, to be honest. In fact, it’s mostly packed up. Like they were planning to make a break for things soon. It’s under their large makeup trunk that I find a tabloid article torn out. “Famous Drag Racer Orpheus Goes on Mysterious Leave of Absence”.

#### MEDEA:

Look at this. They had articles about her absence saved. They definitely didn’t think it was just a little vacation break. 

##### [RUMMAGING]

#### MEDUSA:

They seemed to be trying to figure out the same thing as us. What are you looking for?

#### ANDROMEDA:

Their private comms, darlin’. They wouldn’t have had it in the ship. Those drag outfits don’t have pockets that can hold them. Besides, the racers can get in real trouble if they get caught with it on ‘em. I was thinking our friend here could have some conversations with Orpheus.

#### MEDUSA:

Hold on. Check this out, they left a datapad.

#### MEDEA:

So? I see those all the time; don't you have about fifteen in your pockets right now?

#### MEDUSA:

Only ten, yeah, but this one’s super fancy, [BEEP] military grade. See? I can’t see what’s on it. And that is a seriously good piece of software I ran on it. It’s not Pallas, and it’s not cheap.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Hey, hey, hey, check out the back! Mystery sigil!

#### MEDEA:

Mystery... sigil. 

#### MEDUSA:

It’s a collapsed manual key. Wait, if I can– [BEEPING] and, there. Coordinates.

#### ANDROMEDA:

Eta-X-42-Alpha… That... That’s Nine!

##### [PIANO PLANET NINE THEME BEGINS]


#### MEDEA:
Planet Nine…? That’s ridiculous. I don’t know why anybody would go there voluntarily.

#### ANDROMEDA:

I knew she was round those parts already. You got an answer that makes more sense?

#### MEDEA:

Well, I— No.

#### MEDUSA:

Well, there you have it. We’ll call up Atalanta. Tell her that the Argo needs to set course for Planet Nine.
